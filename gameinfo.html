            Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison,
            working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope.
            The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the
            user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the
            time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by
            Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language
            was written by Charles Kapps[citation needed], who taught computer science at Temple University and
            also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978
            at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 
            1970s and 1980s.
